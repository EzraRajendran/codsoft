## Data

The movie dataset used in this project contains information about movies, including titles, genres, release years, and user ratings. The data is stored in the `data` directory and is preprocessed for recommendation.

## Recommendation Algorithms

### Collaborative Filtering

Collaborative filtering is based on user interactions and similarity between users. It recommends movies that similar users have liked.

### Content-Based Filtering

Content-based filtering recommends movies based on the characteristics of the movies themselves, such as genres, actors, and directors. It suggests movies with features similar to those you've liked.

## Introduction

Welcome to the Image Captioning Project! This project aims to create an AI model capable of generating descriptive captions for images. Whether you're interested in computer vision, natural language processing, or simply want to explore the fusion of both, this project offers a powerful image captioning solution.

## Features

- A deep learning model that combines computer vision and natural language processing.
- Ability to generate human-like captions for images.
- Customizable model and training options.
- Integration potential for various applications, including image recognition and accessibility tools.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Required Python libraries and dependencies (listed in `requirements.txt`).

### Installation

To install and set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-captioning-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd image-captioning-project
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the image captioning model, follow these steps:

1. Run the image captioning application:

   ```bash
   python caption.py --image your-image.jpg
   ```

   Replace `your-image.jpg` with the path to the image you want to caption.

2. The model will analyze the image and generate a descriptive caption.

3. Explore the generated captions and experiment with different images.

## Model Training

If you want to train your own image captioning model, you can follow the instructions in the `train_model` directory. It includes detailed guidelines on preparing your dataset, configuring training parameters, and training the model.
